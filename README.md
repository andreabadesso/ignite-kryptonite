## Ignite Kryptonite

Because you shouldn't need to be Superman (or Wonderwoman) to write an application.

Ignite for your next cool electron thing. Conincidentally, also works _sweet as_ on single page based web projects, as they share many of the same concepts.

Writing a react web is hard. So many choices. Then fitting them all together.

## Warning!!!!
Warning! Warning! ~~Beta~~ ~~Alpha~~ pre-Alpha Software, breaking changes, frequent crashes, lots of bugs, all that stuff. Might not work in your use case, but I'm pretty sure it [WOMM](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=WOMM).

Still here? Cool.

Here are some instructions to get you started:

1. Install the ignite cli, if you haven't done so already - `npm install -g ignite-cli`
2. Run the following command - `ignite new MyAwesomeThing -b ignite-electronite`
  - ProTip: the -b switch means "Use this boilerplate"

This repo assumes you're using [ant.design](https://ant.design/), but feel free to use whatever component prebuilts you like. Or roll your own. You'll just need to mod the templates to suit. If you do want to use ant.design, you'll need to follow these [instructions](https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app).

### Don't like my templates?
Hey, that's cool. I don't mind. All I wanted was to get you started quickly, and help you avoid some of the pain I went through when setting up my projects. Feel free to `ignite spork` and follow your :nose:.

### TODO
- Write some tests. No, really. :)
- Sort out a nested directory structure
- Add a proper boilerplate for both web and electron projects
- Fix the install so we don't have to do the above
- Remove the dependency on ant-design
- Uninstall. Although, I am not sure why you'd want to leave.
- Live long and prosper. ðŸ––
